   <h1>REUSE VS RECYCLE</h1>
   <p>Recycling - it's great! But you'll notice that we are always going on about "reuse" where <br> possible. And here's why!</p> <br><br>
   <p>You've heard of the three R's of environmental sustainability: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. But did <br> you know that they appear in order of importance?</p> <br><br>
   <p>Reducing how much we consume is the most preferred level. Use less stuff! Making a new <br> product requires a lot of materials and energy. As a result, reduction and reuse are the most <br> effective ways to save natural resources, protect the environment, and save your pennies.</p> <br><br>
   <p>Reusing is often confused with recycling, but they are really quite different. Reuse lengthens <br> the life of an item. It is accomplished through many different methods, a perfect example of this <br> is developing products that are reusable and long-lived.</p> <br><br>
   <p>Recycling is the reprocessing of an item into a new raw material for use in a new product. <br> Recycling and Composting are ranked lower than Reduction and Reuse because the process <br> can be more energy-intensive and can generate more pollutants. Although of course it is still <br> the preferred alternative to landfilling!</p> <br><br>
   <p>So why is reuse so important? Simply because it confronts the challenges of waste reduction. <br> Reuse accomplishes these goals more effectively than recycling by:</p> <br><br>
  <p>Taking materials out of the waste stream and results in less hazardous waste</p> <br> 
    <p>Reducing the energy used to manufacture an items</p> <br>
    <p>Creating less air and water pollution than making a new item or recycling</p> <br>
    <p>Reducing the strain on valuable resources (e.g. fuel, forests and water supplies, whilst helps <br> safeguarding wildlife habitats)</p> <br>
    <p>Saving on the cost of purchases and disposal</p> <br>
    <p>Creating an affordable supply of quality goods

<h1>WHAT YOU CAN DO!</h1>
  <p>Reduce! E.g. Print only what's essential, share info electronically instead!</p>
  <p>Reuse. Send recyclables to companies that put them back to use, not to companies that  <br> them out of circulation.</p> 

  <p class="space">Where it's not possible to reduce or reuse, recycle! Raw materials can be used to manufacture <br> new products, saving natural resources, energy and landfill space.</p>
